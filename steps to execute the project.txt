xampp server is used for local hosting..So I recommend using that only.
Also all errors has been fixed ...but if u find any feel free to fix it.

Steps to execute the project :

1.Import the user.sql in database from database folder to the MySql through browser.
2.Copy the Project-Kids folder in xampp/htdocs/
3.Open the brower and type localhost/Project-Kids if on default port.
4.If you want to use php mail function you should configure the php.ini in php folder of xampp
also the sendmail.ini in sendmail folder in xampp. You can take help from youtube doing it.
also you should change the email address "kidsteamatservice@gmail.com" in php files.
5.The working of the project can be seen on the following address- http://smartyj44.000webhostapp.com/
