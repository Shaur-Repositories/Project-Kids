I have used xampp for local hosting..So I prefer installing it.
Also all errors has been fixed ...but if u find any feel free to fix it.

Steps :

1.Import the user.sql in database from database folder.
2.Copy the Project-Kids folder in xampp/htdocs/
3.Open the brower and type localhost/Project-Kids if on default port.
4.If you want to use php mail function you should configure the php.ini in php folder of xampp
also the sendmail.ini in sendmail folder in xampp. You can take help from youtube doing it.
also you should change the email address "kidsteamatservice@gmail.com" in php files.

thank you...
